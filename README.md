# High-Dimensional-Inference-on-Simulated-Imaging-Data-in-MATLAB
Overview

This project demonstrates how sparse regression and high-dimensional inference methods can be implemented conceptually in MATLAB.
Due to the restricted toolbox access in MATLAB Online, this repository presents the complete MATLAB workflow and code with detailed explanations and expected outcomes — serving as a proof of concept for how regularization-based methods can be applied to complex, high-dimensional data structures.

Objectives

Simulate a high-dimensional dataset (n = 100, p = 500) mimicking imaging-genetics data.

Implement and compare LASSO, Ridge, and Elastic Net regression models.

Apply Debiased LASSO for valid inference and bias correction.

Design a reproducible MATLAB workflow demonstrating conceptual mastery of sparse modeling.

Project Highlights

End-to-End Workflow: Covers simulation, standardization, model fitting, cross-validation, and inference.

Conceptual Implementation: Designed for environments with limited toolbox access.

Clear Documentation: Every code block includes comments explaining logic and purpose.

Debiased LASSO Extension: Bridges prediction with inference for high-dimensional models.

Expected Outcomes

Sparse coefficient selection by LASSO and Elastic Net.

Comparison of regularization paths across models.

Insight into how penalty terms control overfitting in large predictor spaces.

Theoretical understanding of how debiasing restores valid statistical inference.

Reflection

This project reflects an independent and thoughtful approach to statistical learning in MATLAB.
It shows that even with software constraints, one can design a rigorous, well-documented analytical framework grounded in theory and reproducibility — a mindset essential in high-dimensional research.
